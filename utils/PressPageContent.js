        It is often said that the best investment one can make is to own real estate, so when you’re ready to invest, it makes sense to do business with a leader in the field — Scope Realty.
        <br />
        The company’s President, Paul Reisner, says, “We are currently the 15th largest real estate firm in New York, according to the Real Deal Magazine.”
        <br />
        The firm has 261 agents who have sold homes this past year, including sales in booming neighborhoods such as Williams Bridge, Wakefield, and Soundview in the Bronx; and in the neighborhoods of Rochdale, Jamaica, and Laurelton in Queens.
        <br />
        Scope can be depended upon for commercial real estate, private houses, or rentals. The company invests in its agents, assuring their success, by providing training and support. With a team this strong, you know you can rely upon them, too.
        <br />
        A reputation such as theirs also comes with a responsibility to give back to the community, and Scope has taken steps to assure that is part of their plan.
        <br />
        “We know that our long-term success is directly linked to the success of our clients and the communities we serve,” Reisner says. As a result, Scope has developed relationships with nonprofits. The objective is to help strengthen the communities in which they operate, and also to grow local economies around the world, says Reisner.
        <br />
        Among the charities in which the company is involved includes St. Jude’s Research Hospital, the noted organization that helps children and their families who are dealing with cancer and other life-threatening diseases. St. Jude’s never gives parents a bill for their services as it believes parents’ only concern should be the health of their child.
        <br />
        Another charity is Covenant House, with 21 locations in the United States, Canada, and South America, that serve more than 56,000 homeless people each year. It is the nation’s largest, privately-funded agency, helping homeless, runaways, and at-risk youth. It started locally, more than 40 years ago, when six young runaways in Manhattan were given shelter from a snowstorm. Today, the doors of this organization are open 24 hours a day for any young person in need.
        <br />
        Animal welfare is a topic that Scope Realty is passionate about, too, and why it has a close relationship with The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Based in New York City since its inception in 1866, the ASPCA’s mission is to provide effective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals throughout the United States.
        <br />
        “We are happy to help financially strengthen the amazing work that these charities do on a daily basis,” says Reisner.
        Scope Realty offers monetary support and more.
        <br />
        “Our team members help us make an even bigger impact through their passion, time, and expertise,” says Reisner.
        <br />
        Scope Realty has grown tremendously and continues its expansion, with new offices opening in Soho, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx in the near future.
        <br />
        Reisner believes the company’s success stems from, “our diversity, and our ability to serve every community across the city by speaking their language and living in these neighborhoods.”
        <br />

        Paul Reisner of Scope Realty had a vision: He wanted to create a real estate company that invested in its agents’ success.
        <br />
        He would pay for them to become licensed, provide them with listings and leads, and then continue to educate and train them each week. In short, it was a model that would make it impossible for them to fail because, “We would invest in them from Day One,” says Reisner.
        <br />
        This thinking was revolutionary. Reisner has spent years in the industry, and as far as he knows, no other real estate company had done anything like this.
        <br />
        To bring this vision to fruition, he created Scope Realty, and it has become “the fastest-growing real estate office ever,” says Reisner. In just 14 months, it had 252 agents.
        <br />
        Michelle Roitman is one of the agents who signed on early.
        <br />
        “The day I came in for my interview, I knew that this was the place for me,” she says. And she still feels this same way today. “They are always cheering you on, and doing everything they can to make your life easy.”
        <br />
        A big benefit — one that she finds instrumental to success — is that the office has a driver and company car, available for use at any time.
        <br />
        “What other company does that?” she says.
        <br />
        In addition, “There are amazing mentors, willing to teach you and guide you, every step of the way.”
        <br />
        Cleveland Stewart, another Scope agent, agrees.
        <br />
        “Working for Scope has taught me a tremendous amount over the last year,” he says. “Paul Reisner, the president, and Chris Fenelus, the CEO, are always a phone call away.”
        <br />
        New York real estate can be a difficult place is for newcomers. It is already crowded with firms that have been around for decades, and these recognizable names make it nearly impossible for the new guy on the block to break into the marketplace. This is part of what makes Scope Realty so unique. The company has broken the traditional mold, and by doing so, has shattered the barriers. This fresh, innovative way of doing business creates a winning situation for both the buyer and the seller. Whether it involves commercial real estate, private houses, or rentals, Scope has become a leader in the field.
        <br />
        “Scope is the only one to consider,” says Stewart. “There is always an opportunity to help clients purchase a home, sell a home, or rent an apartment.”
        <br />
        Reisner adds that its management team, brokers, and agents are as diverse as the city itself.
        <br />
        “Our strength as a company comes from our diversity, and our ability to serve every community across the city by speaking their language and living in these neighborho­ods.”
        <br />
        Realtor Michael Donkis says Scope offers more to agents than, “anyone out there.” This makes it a win-win for all parties because, “When you pair a solid foundation like Scope Realty, with a determined work ethic, you will see real results.”
        <br />
        Scope Realty is expanding, with new offices that will be opening in Soho, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx in the near future.

    title: 'Amazon Talk Dominates Tribune Landscape Event',

        Last Thursday, the Queens Tribune hosted its first Changing Landscape of Queens event, exploring the booming development in the borough and issues related to the rapid growth. Unsurprisingly, the impact of Amazon’s building a 25,000-employee corporate headquarters in Long Island City dominated the discussion of the panel, which included New York City Councilman Francisco Moya, NYC Economic Development Corporation VP of Development Nate Bliss, Queens Chamber of Commerce President Tom Grech and Christopher Fenelus, the CEO of Scope Realty.
        <br />
        Reaction to the news was overwhelmingly positive. Grech focused on the multiplying effect that the high-paying jobs would have on the borough, creating new customers for existing businesses in western Queens and beyond. The Chamber president added that if Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s estimated return on the $3 billion in incentives was indeed 9 to 1, then the borough would make out great on the deal.
        <br />
        EDC’s Bliss pointed out that Amazon’s developing in Long Island City is a natural next step for the decades-long plan of development for the area. Residential buildings have been shooting up at an incredibly fast rate in LIC, and Amazon’s moving its headquarters to the facility is going to create more balance between residential and commercial.
        <br />
        While not opposed to the deal, Councilman Moya did raise concerns he has about Amazon’s coming.
        <br />
        “Growth itself shouldn’t frighten us, but growth without proper planning should. My biggest fear is that development will price out Queens residents and the character of our neighborhoods,” Moya said.
        <br />
        He added that by circumventing the normal process for development, Amazon has started from a point where the community feels on the outside. He said the process that exists for land-use projects, which involves the local community boards and other stakeholders, can often lead to a better plan for all involved, including developers and incoming businesses.
        <br />
        Moya was also concerned that Amazon’s arrival could drive up housing prices. This was a sentiment echoed by Scope Realty’s Fenelus, who represents one of the most diverse real estate firms in New York City.
        <br />
        Long Island City is not the only place growing rapidly in Queens. The panel discussed the development in Jamaica, with Bliss speaking about the similarities that area has with Long Island City. Residential units have been popping up in downtown Jamaica around the Long Island Rail Road hub and the AirTrain access to JFK Airport. Bliss suggested that commercial development, and potentially even corporate headquarters, could be in the works for the area in coming years because of the current groundwork being laid there.
        <br />
        The discussion concluded with an update on Willets Point development from Councilman Moya, who was pleased with the progress at the site. Currently six acres of land have been earmarked for the development of affordable housing and senior housing. Moya, an avid fan of soccer, also said he is still optimistic that a soccer stadium would be built at the site. Bliss added that he is hopeful that in 10 years, Willets Point will be fully remediated and that buildings will be starting to go up at the location.
        <br />
        The event was sponsored by Scope Realty, the Queens Chamber of Commerce, Bird Scooters and SPACES. Borough President Melinda Katz delivered the keynote address before the panel discussion.

    title: 'Realty Company Empowers Its Agents',
    subtitle: 'Queens Tribune',

        According to Zach Tatge—the chief operating officer and co-founder of Scope Realty, a New York City-based full-service boutique brokerage firm—approximately 87 percent of real estate agents fail professionally in their first four years.
        <br />
        Scope Realty was founded in August 2017 by Tatge, and today has 74 agents operating out of its Midtown Manhattan and Sunnyside offices.
        <br />
        “Sunnyside, Queens, is an amazing neighborhood,” said Tatge. “It’s close to everything. If you need to get to any of the boroughs, you can easily. It’s centrally located for those people who are going to be working in the outer boroughs.”
        <br />
        Tatge said that he wanted to start a real estate business since noticing that agents going into real estate companies are not given leads and lack proper training.
        <br />
        “When given the necessary information, tools and training, agents can move along and make money,” said Tatge.
        <br />
        With its mission statement being “to deliver exceptional integrated real estate services for all aspects of the real estate market,” Tatge said that Scope provides ongoing training throughout an agent’s entire career with the company.
        <br />
        “In addition to training on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I am one phone call away,” said Tatge. “How many businesses allow you to get in contact with the COO directly and you actually get through?”
        <br />
        Tatge said that agents are constantly calling him whenever they run into any problems or have general questions. Aside from the training that Scope Realty provides to its agents, Tatge said the company also does much of the legwork with which other companies overwhelm their agents.
        <br />
        Rather than making agents responsible for all of the prospecting, Scope provides all of the information and resources that agents need, allowing them to focus on making phone calls and sealing deals. It’s through this method that agents can focus on their leads and preserving the money in their pockets.
        <br />
        “We eliminate all the work,” said Tatge. “All the agent has to do is show up and have full communication with their buyers. It’s our system that is our competitive advantage.”
        <br />
        Tatge used the example of a nurse who works a three-day week, who might contact an agent on her day off but is unavailable on other days. Since agents are only responsible for their own customers, whenever that nurse is free, the agent will be able to take the call immediately and have a number of units to show her.
        <br />
        “It’s our system that we have in place that is our competitive advantage because we’ve taken away all the work,” said Tatge.
        <br />
        “We believe in knowledge, we believe in information—not only to absorb it, but to apply it. So, we’re willing to invest in our agents.”
        <br />
        Tatge said that the most frequent mistakes he notices by agents revolve around prospecting inconsistency, time management, organization and improper mindset.
        <br />
        “I always tell my agents to ‘find your why,’” said Tatge. “I know that’s a difficult question, but it’s important to know why you’re doing real estate. What is your purpose and what are you working towards? If you don’t have something so powerful that makes you willing to sacrifice everything you have going on, I’m not sure you’re going to have the ability to reach the true success you want in your life.
        <br />
        Tatge said that his motivation is family. Quite simply, he knows that if he doesn’t fulfill his tasks, he will not be able to provide.
        <br />
