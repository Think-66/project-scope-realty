To help us fulfill this social responsibility, we have partnered with St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital.

The hospital is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90% and won’t stop until no child dies from cancer.</p>

Our contribution to the hospital allows them to offer free treatments, travel, housing, and food to the patient’s families to reduce their financial and emotional burden. It helps these families to focus on their child’s health instead of worrying about the cost of their care.</p>

                                                    <p>At least 26,500 children were reported to have run away from their homes in 2020, and actual figures are likely to be even higher. While the reasons for their choice vary, each of them is in an extremely vulnerable position without having a place to call home.</p>
                                                    <p>Scope Realty hopes to support children without a home by providing them with necessities while they try to become more stable. For this cause, we have partnered with Covenant House, the nation’s largest privately-funded agency serving homeless, runaway, and at-risk youth.</p>
                                                    <p>Covenant House was established 40 years ago and has since grown to establish its presence in 21 locations across the USA, Canada, and Latin America. They serve more than 56,000 homeless people annually and focus on providing shelter to children in risky, vulnerable, or abusive situations.</p>
                                                    <p>We believe in making our communities safe for homeless and vulnerable children and are working with Covenant House to enhance their efforts in making this dream a reality.</p>
