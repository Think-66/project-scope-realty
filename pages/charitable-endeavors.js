Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since it opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90%. They won't stop until no child dies from cancer</p>

                                                    <p>Covenant House began over 40 years ago when six young runaways were given shelter from a snowstorm, in the lower east side of Manhattan. Today there are 21 Covenant House locations in the USA, Canada and Latin America. Together they serve more than 56,000 homeless young people each year.
                                                        They are the nation’s largest privately funded agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth. Their doors are open 24 hours a day for youth in need. At Scope Realty we not only find our clients their dream property, but also give back to the youth of the community by contributing to the Covenant House, in order to help financially strengthen the amazing work that they do on a daily basis.</p>
